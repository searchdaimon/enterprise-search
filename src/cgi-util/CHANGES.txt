CHANGES.txt for cgi-util:

(Changes by Bill Kendrick <bill@newbreedsoftware.com> unless otherwise noted.)

2.1.7  - 2002.Oct.18 - Fixed CONTENT_TYPE check so that HTTPS GET works.
                       Robert Alloway <rob@servicecentre.co.uk>

2.1.6  - 2002.Sep.26 - 'extern "C" { ... }' added to cgi-util.h, for C++
                       compilers.
                       Tony Hansen <tony@att.com>

                     - 'unsigned char' casts added to avoid gcc warnings.
                       Tony Hansen <tony@att.com>

                     - cgi_getnentrystr() returns NULL instead of "x"
                       Tony Hansen <tony@att.com>

2.1.5  - 2002.Sep.26 - Fixed incorrect return value in cgi_dump_no_abort()
                       Tony Hansen <tony@att.com>

2.1.4  - 2002.May.1 - Added 'n' functions (eg, "cgi_getnentrystr()") for
                      handling multiple form values with the same name.
                      Stephen Woodbridge <woodbri@swoodbridge.com>

2.1.3  - 2001.May.15 - Missing QUERY_STRING ignored (for compatibility
                       with "boa" and "thttp" webservers).  Rather than
                       return a "CGIERR_NULL_QUERY_STRING", it now sets
                       the query string to an empty string ("").
                       Ian Leonard <ileonard@ntlworld.com>

2.1.2  - 2000.November.1 - cgi_getcookie() function restructuring.
                           Chris Wareham <chris.wareham@catchword.com>

2.1.1  - 2000.August.28 - "install" depended on "tests-cgis" instead of
                          "test-cgis".  (Typo!)

                          Made cgi-util handle "="'s within values better.
                          (eg. "prog.cgi?char==" or "prog.cgi?pair=123=456")
                          Masayuki Yamaguchi <yamaguchi@coolinx.net>

2.1.0  - 2000.July.26 - Added initial browser file upload support.
                        (Content-Type="multipart/form-data", RFC 1867)

                      - Fixed "README.txt" to not call functions 'programs'
                        (I must have been asleep when I wrote it!)

                      - Added a file-upload example CGI and form,
                        "filetest.c" and "filetest.html".

                      - Added global "cgi_content_type" variable.

                      - Added a "content_type" field to the
                        "cgi_entry_type" structure.

                      - Added "cgi_getentrytype()" function.

                      - Added a "content_length" field to the
                        "cgi_entry_type" structure.

                      - ".txt" extensions added to documentation files.

                      - "makefile" renamed "Makefile".

                      - Set "LIBDIR" and "INCDIR" variables in "Makefile."
                        Tobias Jahn <tjahn@sourceforge.net>

                      - Set "CC=gcc" in "Makefile," since some "cc"'s
                        don't like the "-Wall" switch.
                        Tobias Jahn <tjahn@sourceforge.net>

                      - Added "install-h" rule to "Makefile", and had
                        "install-o", "install-a" and "install-so"
                        require it.  (Before, only "install-o" installed
                        the "cgi-util.h" file.  Now all three do.)

                      - "query" variable renamed to "cgi_query" (to keep
                        from interfering with anyone else's declaration).
                        <jengo@mail.com>

                      - Boolean function accepts strings "true" and "false"
                        now, too.
                        Denis <lovebyte2000@yahoo.com>

                      - cgi_getcookie() function added.
                        Pete Cassidy <pcassidy@iol.ie>

                      - Added a copy of the GNU Library General Public License
                        (LGPL) to the package.

                      - cgi-util.h now creates a "CGI_UTIL_H" #define.

2.0.4  - 1999.August.24 - The "unescape_url" code was too trusting.
                          MJ Pomraning <pilcrow@mailbag.com>

2.0.3  - 1999.August.13 - Some debugging code was left in 2.0.2.  It has been
                          removed.
                          Stan Osborne <stan@ana.com>

2.0.2  - 1999.August.9 - If a POST-method submittion contained an "&" within
                         one of the field's values, the value would be
                         truncated.  This should be fixed.
                         Ruediger Geys <aage@fen.baynet.de>

                       - CGIUTILVER (defined in "cgi-util.h") now
                         reports complete version number (2.0.2).

2.0.1  - 1999.July.12 - malloc() fix in cgi_init()
                        Tadek Orlowski <orlowski@epnet.com>

2.0    - 1999.July.12 - Initlial re-release
                        Bill Kendrick <bill@newbreedsoftware.com>
                        Mike Simons <msimons@moria.simons-clan.com>
