v0.8.5  - Added 'make install-mp3info' and 'make install-gmp3info' options to
	  Makefile (Felix Kronlage)
	- Fixed a bug in the windows version that caused it to blow up or give
	  erroneous output on certain MP3 files
	- Added handling of 'free form' bitrate frames, the lack of which was
	  causing segfaults on AMD 64-bit sytems
	- Tweaked code to eliminate various gcc warnings and errors
	- Improved detection of invalid MP3 frames (Ben Bennett)
	- Updated gmp3info for GTK 2 (Eric Lassauge)
	- Miscellaneous documentation updates and corrections

v0.8.4  - Added %k format specifier to allow printing of the file size
	  in formatted text output (-p option) (Thanks to Sascha Luedecke
	  <sascha@meta-x.de>)
	- Rearranged some items in the man page and quick help (-h)
	  to make them more readable.
	- Fixed minor logic bug in mp3tech (pointed out by Moshe
	  Jacobson <moshe@togetherweb.com>)
	- Now compiles under CYGWIN32 (Julia A. Case <julie@MageNet.com>).
	- The following fixes were contributed by Pawel
	  Wiecek <coven@debian.org>
		- Manual page typos fixed
		- Now correctly recognizes and reports MPEG version 2.5 files
		- Clearing individual ID3 fields can now be accomplished
		  by passing a blank argument ("") to any tag setting
		  switch (-t, -a, etc.)
 
v0.8.3  - Fixed a bug in GTK version that showed garbage or nothing
	  where track information should have been displayed.
	- Fixed a bug that prevented the interactive curses version from
	  changing from one genre to another if the second genre contained
          fewer characters than the first.
	- Ricardo Cerqueria contributed the following enhancements:
	- Added a FILE | OPEN menu to the GTK version
        - Added a technical information view to the GTK version
	- Added an 'About' box to GTK version

v0.8.2  - Fixed a bug which caused mp3info to erroneously report some 
	  constant bitrate (CBR) files as variable bitrate (VBR) files.

v0.8.1  - Fixed an elusive bug that sometimes caused mp3info to fail to
	  find an ID3 tag even when one was present.

v0.8	- Added the ability to handle VBR (Variable Bit Rate) MP3 files
	- Added the ability to deal with garbage or non-standard headers
          at the beginning of a file
	- Added user-specifiable output format with capabilities similar
	  to printf(3)
	- The GTK version now handles read-only files correctly
	- Techincal Info display (-x) greatly improved and is now
	  considered reliable.
	- UNIX man page created for mp3info (console version only)
	- Major internal code re-engineering

v0.7    - Added extended genres (taken from WinAmp).
	- Fixed minor bug in genre list display
        - Fixed a bug in the GTK version which set the genre to 'Blues' if 
          the MP3 file did not have an existing ID3 tag.
        - Help screen and documentation fixed up and edited for clarity.
	- Added -f switch to force MP3Info to process files as if they were
	  MP3's even if they don't contain the standard MP3 header.
	- Added support for ID3 v1.1 tags (track numbers) - Thanks to Don
          Melton (don@blivet.com)
	- Added an option (-x) to display technical information about the 
          MP3 file.  This is an experimental feature and should not be
	  considered reliable.

v0.6.1  - Fixed a bug introduced in 0.6 that set genre to 'Blues' if no genre
	  was given on the command line and the MP3 file did not have an
	  existing ID3 tag.

v0.6	- As of this version maintenance of mp3info has been taken over 
	  by Cedric Tefft <cedric@phreaker.net>
	- Reworked command-line/curses version to handle processing multiple MP3's.
	- Added the capability to delete an existing ID3 tag (-d switch)
	- Added full text/numeric genre handling to command-line, curses and GTK modes.
	- Added the capability to display the list of valid genres (-G switch)
	- View mode is now determined automatically when no other options are specified.  
	  The -v option is accepted for backward compatibility, but ignored.  It 
	  should probably be removed in a future version.
	- Added ID3 structure to make internal argument passing a little cleaner.
	- Consolidated ID3 tag reading/writing code.
	- Interactive mode now displays existing tags.
	- Modified Makefile to make gmp3info dependant on gmp3info.c

v0.5	- Added genre tag. (Still in numerical form) (Thanks to jsc@arsdigita.com)
	- Corrected a byte ordering bug which affected Sun systems (Thanks to Benjamin Korvemaker)
	- Corrected a permissions bug (Thanks to Carsten Hahn)
	- Fixed a GTK bug in gmp3info. (Thanks go to Thomas Schultz)

v0.4	- gmp3info is now part of the pack.

v0.3.1	- Fixed a couple of HP/UX incompatibilities (Thanks to Petter Reinholdtsen)
	- Added -v (to view an existing tag)

v0.3	- Fixed "trash in the fields" bug. (Strings are now forced to be null-terminated)
	  Updated help screen.
	  Fixed minor warnings during compile.
	  If "-h" is among options, others are now ignored.
